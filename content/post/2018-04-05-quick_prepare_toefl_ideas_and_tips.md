I wanted to share some tips on quickly preparing for the TOEFL iBT test.
I had to take TOEFL on a short notice, I had two weeks to take the exam and had prepared using materials that I will share in this post.
It helped me get a decent score (106/120) and I wanted to share those incredible materials that helped me with everyone who is looking to ace the exam in a short span of time.

## Go through the free materials from Notefull
Link [notefull](https://www.notefull.com/)
This is an absolute must.
They give a breakdown of the different sections and what to expect in each section, we can learn the structure of the exam which is the very important step.
They also discuss the strategy to approach various parts of the exam and question types. 
The strategies for reading sections are very important, to keep up with the time requirement.
There are stragegies for speaking sections with templates for each question types.
For listening section there are note taking tips which are useful, but I tend to follow a tree like notes structure.
The presentation styles ( 2 or 3 para) and template is thought for the writing section

If there is no time for anything else, please go through this atleast.
This will give a high reward for the time spent and the instructions are very short and clear
Find your weak point and improve on them.
There are many review videos which discusses sample questions which gives a taste of what is going to come.

## linguamarina's channel for tips on speaking and to compliment the Notefull videos on test sctructure and time management
Next is linguamarina's [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQg09FkoobmLquNNoO4ulg), she gives many practical advice and tips.
Sometimes her instructor Jonathan joins her and walks through TOEFL sections and questions.
I learned a very important tip of writing down the speaking section template from her videos and also tips for writing sections

Important videos from her site to start with are

[How to Study for TOEFL in 7 Days: Tips, Tricks and Things to Take With You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBr4eSka7wg)
[How to Score 117 out of 120 on TOEFL: Speaking Part and Writing Essays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YofpGCq81sQ&t=5s)

## Tips
Practice with same questions again and again instead of jumping question sets (Thanks, Joseph from notefull)
Follow Notefull's advice, seriously, I tried to explore a different style and my score suffered in writing.
Write the template, free time before test begins when reading instructions or during break.
Relax and trust in the omnipresent.
Bring ear buds since the room is quite noisy, also bring some throat soothing candy to take during break.
