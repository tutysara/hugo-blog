I was writing my blog and added a link to google plus in the sidebar. I wanted to make a human readable/rememberable Id to use for my google plus page.

I guess, planning to {use|add link} to google plus is a bad idea. 
I googled to find the steps to create a custom profile Id and landed in the documentation page -- [Get a custom URL for your Google+ profile](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/2676340?hl=en)

I tried following the steps and surprisingly it didn't worked, I trusted google so much that I thought I may have did some mistake and repeated the steps one more time but still it didn't worked.

I was left in dark, I followed the exact steps given in the support page and still couldn't get it working and was wondering what am I doing wrong. 

After some hair pulling moments, decided to search to find if anyone has the same issue and bang got this  -- [stackexchange q&A](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/89131/how-can-i-get-a-custom-google-plus-profile-url-using-the-new-google-plus).

The documenation is out of date with the product, the product is updated to a new interface but the support documenation still has the steps using the old layout.

Looks like there is no way to get custom profile id from settings page using the new google+, we have to switch back to Classic Google+, follow the steps in the [documentation](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/2676340?hl=en) to create a custom profile id and then switch back to use the new Google+

I couldn't believe google couldn't even get such a basic thing corrected. Considering the push they had with google plus initially I didn't expected they deliver a product with such quality. As a consumer I don't expect a product to have n number of features, I like something which is simple, does a few things and does it really well. I was able to create a custom profile id by switching back to the classic layout but found about the quality of google products and how well they support it the hard way.
